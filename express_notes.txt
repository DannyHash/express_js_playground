use "type": "module" to be able to use the latest 'import' and 'export' features
remember to change the file name by indexing the paths with '-m' eg. "main": "index.mjs"

Query parameters are extra pieces of data you can pass in the URL after a question mark. They’re accessed via the req.query object. For example, in a URL like /search?term=javascript, req.query would be { term: 'javascript' }. They’re useful for filtering or customizing responses without changing the URL structure.
